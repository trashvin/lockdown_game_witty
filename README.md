lockdown is a simple arcade game based on a popular retro game 'breakout'. this is an output from witty academy sessions for game app development using python and pygame. the topics and lessons can be found on this [link](https://trashvin.github.io/python-gamedev-2021/).

# the story

Year 2020, a pandemic happened because of Covid 19. In a small town in the Philippines, they have developed a new method of collecting these viruses. Collected viruses are stored in a tightly sealed container where they are destroyed by a new process. Viruses are burned in microscopic level by a kinetic fire generated by bouncing the fire in the container. However,there are instances where the ball of fire losses its kinetic energy and viruses contaminates the sorrounding environment causing a lockdown.

## how to's

### how to add modify the level layout

- level layouts are located in src/assets/files/. the files are text files with the 'ldk' extension.
- the contents of the file is a matrix representing either a covid virus or a brick.
```
covid viruses
1 - alpha variant
2 - beta variant
3 - delta variant
4 - lamda variant

bricks
11 - regular brick
12 - power brick

level file content example
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,3,1
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
```

#### how to add a level

- to add a new level, create a level layout file and save it in src/assets/files/. use the following format for the filename :
  format : level_<level>.ldk
  e.g.   : level_1.ldk
- modify constants.py and set the value of MAX_LEVEL to the new level count.
